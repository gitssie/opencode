- To regenerate the JavaScript SDK, run `./packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts`.
- The default branch in this repo is `dev`.
- Local `main` ref may not exist; use `dev` or `origin/dev` for diffs.

## Branch Names

Use a short branch name of at most three words, separated by hyphens. Do not use slashes or type prefixes such as `feat/` or `fix/`.

Examples: `session-recovery`, `fix-scroll-state`, `regenerate-sdk`.

## Commits and PR Titles

Use conventional commit-style messages and PR titles: `type(scope): summary`.

Valid types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, and `test`. Scopes are optional; use the affected package or area when helpful, e.g. `core`, `opencode`, `tui`, `app`, `desktop`, `sdk`, or `plugin`.

Examples: `fix(tui): simplify thinking toggle styling`, `docs: update contributing guide`, `chore(sdk): regenerate types`.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Do not extract single-use helpers preemptively. Inline the logic at the call site unless the helper is reused, hides a genuinely complex boundary, or has a clear independent name that improves the caller.
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream
- In `src/config`, follow the existing self-export pattern at the top of the file (for example `export * as ConfigAgent from "./agent"`) when adding a new config module.

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Imports

- Never alias imports. Do not use `import { foo as bar } from "..."` or renamed imports like `resolve as pathResolve`.
- Never use star imports. Do not use `import * as Foo from "..."` or `import type * as Foo from "..."`.
- If a namespace-style value is needed, import the module's own exported namespace by name, for example `import { Project } from "@opencode-ai/core/project"`, then reference `Project.ID`.
- Prefer dynamic imports for heavy modules that are only needed in selected code paths, especially in startup-sensitive entrypoints. Destructure dynamic import bindings near the top of the narrowest scope that needs them so they read like normal imports. Avoid inline chains such as `await import("./module").then((mod) => mod.value())` or `(await import("./module")).value()`. Keep branch-specific imports inside the branch that needs them to preserve lazy loading.

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Complex Logic

When a function has several validation branches or supporting details, make the main function read as the happy path and move supporting details into small helpers below it.

```ts
// Good
export function loadThing(input: unknown) {
  const config = requireConfig(input)
  const metadata = readMetadata(input)
  return createThing({ config, metadata })
}

function requireConfig(input: unknown) {
  ...
}
```

- Keep helpers close to the code they support, below the main export when that improves readability.
- Do not over-abstract simple expressions into many single-use helpers; extract only when it names a real concept like `requireConfig` or `readMetadata`.
- Do not return `Effect` from helpers unless they actually perform effectful work. Synchronous parsing, validation, and option building should stay synchronous.
- Prefer Effect schema helpers such as `Schema.UnknownFromJsonString` and `Schema.decodeUnknownOption` over manual `JSON.parse` wrapped in `Effect.try` when parsing untrusted JSON strings.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints and surprising behavior, not for obvious assignments or control flow.

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.

## V2 Session Core

- Keep durable prompt admission separate from model execution. `SessionV2.prompt(...)` admits one durable `session_input` row before scheduling advisory `SessionExecution.wake(sessionID)` unless `resume: false` requests admit-only behavior. The serialized runner promotes admitted inputs into visible user messages at safe boundaries.
- Reusing a Session ID adopts the existing Session. Reusing a prompt message ID reconciles an exact retry only when Session, prompt, and delivery mode match; conflicting reuse fails. Historical projected prompts lazily synthesize promoted inbox records during exact retry.
- Keep `SessionExecution` process-global and Session-ID based. Its local implementation owns the process-local Session coordinator and discovers placement through `SessionStore` plus `LocationServiceMap.get(session.location)` only when a drain starts; no layer should take a Session ID. V2 interruption targets the active process-local ownership chain for that Session; idle or missing interruption is a no-op.
- Keep `SessionRunner`, model resolution, tool registry, permissions, and filesystem Location-scoped. Omitted `Location.workspaceID` means implicit-local placement; explicit workspace identity remains reserved for future placement semantics.
- Preserve one explicit `llm.stream(request)` call per provider turn and reload projected history before durable continuation. Do not bridge through legacy `SessionPrompt.loop(...)` or delegate orchestration to an in-memory tool loop.
- Keep local Session drains process-local until clustering is implemented. `SessionRunCoordinator` joins explicit same-Session resumes, coalesces prompt wakeups, and allows different Sessions to run concurrently. Advisory wakes drain eligible durable inbox rows only; post-crash activity recovery requires a separate explicit design before it may retry provider work.
- Keep delivery vocabulary explicit. Prompts steer by default and coalesce into the active activity at the next safe provider-turn boundary. Explicit `queue` inputs open FIFO future activities one at a time after the active activity settles.
- Keep EventV2 replay owner claims separate from clustered Session execution ownership.
- Keep the System Context algebra, registry, and built-ins in `src/system-context`; keep Context Source producers with their observed domains, and keep Session History selection plus Context Epoch persistence Session-owned.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
